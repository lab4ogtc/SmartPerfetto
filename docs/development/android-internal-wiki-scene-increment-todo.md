# Android Internal Wiki Scene Increment TODO

## Goal

Turn the completed Android Internal Wiki reading record into scene-by-scene,
verifiable SmartPerfetto Skill and Strategy increments.

This TODO is the execution ledger for the second phase after
`android-internal-wiki-skill-strategy-review.md`. The earlier batch shipped
global evidence guardrails and a few overclaim fixes. This phase must not stay
at generic prompt policy. Each increment must improve a concrete scene contract,
Skill output, or testable routing/report behavior.

## Current Result Review

### Already Strong Enough To Avoid Rewriting

- `backend/strategies/anr.strategy.md`
  - Current coverage already includes ANR type/timeouts, `freeze_verdict`,
    event-window clipping, direct blocker classification, nativePollOnce
    caveats, Binder/lock/IO/GC/scheduler boundaries, multi-ANR isolation,
    `logcat_event_context`, and system-vs-app attribution.
  - Wiki material still has value, but the next ANR increment should first
    improve the user-facing output contract and tests, not duplicate the
    strategy body.

- `backend/strategies/startup.strategy.md`
  - Current coverage already includes startup type correction, TTID/TTFD,
    startup detail artifacts, Binder/IO/GC/JIT/thermal/memory pressure,
    content provider, WebView/Flutter, slow-reason taxonomy, and final report
    contract.
  - Remaining wiki work should be small and evidence-specific, such as
    external diagnostic API/version caveats or 16 KB/native-loading checks when
    directly testable.

- `backend/strategies/scrolling.strategy.md` and
  `backend/strategies/pipeline.strategy.md`
  - Current coverage is strong for mixed rendering, host-vs-producer-vs-SF
    attribution, architecture-specific jank, and FrameTimeline boundaries.
  - Remaining work should target missing deterministic evidence around
    BufferQueue/fence/graphic-memory or refresh-rate policy, with trace tests.

- `backend/strategies/power.strategy.md`
  - Current coverage already has data gates, Wattson/rail vs fallback, battery
    drain chain, wakelock thresholds, Doze, thermal, and confidence levels.
  - Remaining wiki work is narrower: JobScheduler/WorkManager/FGS pending-vs-
    stop reasons, Android 16/17 background limits, and explicit validation
    paths when rail data is missing.

- `backend/strategies/network.strategy.md`
  - Current coverage already guards packet-level evidence from DNS/connect/TLS/
    TTFB overclaims.
  - Future network work should only add request-stage logic if the repo has a
    deterministic Skill, trace, or user-provided telemetry input to validate it.

### Thin Or Under-Tested Areas

- `backend/strategies/memory.strategy.md`
  - Current strategy is much thinner than the wiki evidence model. It does not
    yet force Java Heap, Native Heap, Graphics/dma-buf, SO mappings, anonymous
    mmap, RSS/PSS, GC churn, LMK, freezer, and modern MemoryLimiter/API
    boundaries into the report contract.

- `backend/skills/config/conclusion_scene_templates.base.yaml`
  - ANR and memory scene output requirements are weaker than their strategies
    and wiki-derived evidence contracts. This is a high-leverage surface because
    it shapes final user-facing conclusions.

- Storage and SQLite
  - There is an `io` conclusion scene and generic strategy coverage, but no
    dedicated scene strategy for file/SP/fsync vs SQLite/Room/provider
    attribution. Wiki articles contain enough material to split this later.

- Input and interaction
  - `interaction.strategy.md` and `scroll-response.strategy.md` cover the happy
    interaction path. Wiki material adds InputDispatcher stale events,
    no-focused-window ANR, focus/window metadata, and `FINISHED` ack semantics
    that need focused validation before broad prompt expansion.

- Graphics memory and BufferQueue/fence
  - Pipeline skills contain many architecture modules, but wiki review points
    to a testable gap around GraphicBuffer/dma-buf memory vs BufferQueue state
    vs fence waits.

## Definition Of Done For Each Increment

Each TODO item can be marked done only when all applicable gates pass:

- Architecture review: the change uses existing strategy, template, Skill YAML,
  and test surfaces rather than TypeScript hardcoding.
- Evidence contract: the output names evidence source, subsystem/stage,
  confidence, and missing data when applicable.
- Focused tests: add or update the owning unit/eval tests for changed behavior.
- Validation: run `cd backend && npm run validate:strategies` for strategy or
  strategy-template changes, and `cd backend && npm run validate:skills` for
  `.skill.yaml` Skill changes.
- Scene template config changes require focused Jest coverage because
  `validate:skills` does not currently validate
  `backend/skills/config/conclusion_scene_templates.base.yaml`.
- Required project gates: run `cd backend && npm run build` and
  `cd backend && npm run test:scene-trace-regression`.
- Landing gate: run `npm run verify:pr` from repo root before final commit/push.
- Review gate: run independent read-only plan review before non-trivial
  implementation, and read-only post-diff review before commit.

## Execution Order

### Batch 1 - Output Contract Hardening For Already-Covered ANR And Thin Memory

- [x] TODO-001: ANR conclusion output contract
  - Target files:
    - `backend/skills/config/conclusion_scene_templates.base.yaml`
    - `backend/src/agent/core/__tests__/conclusionSceneTemplates.test.ts`
  - Current strategy coverage:
    - `anr.strategy.md` already has strong typed-window and evidence-boundary
      rules.
  - Gap:
    - The conclusion scene template only asks for one blocking evidence item and
      broad categories. It does not force ANR type, timeout source,
      system-confirmed vs watchdog/suspected, subject-vs-root-cause process,
      direct blocker, evidence gap, or nativePollOnce caveat into concise final
      output.
  - Implementation:
    - Add concise output requirements to the `anr` scene template.
    - Add focused tests asserting the template includes the ANR evidence
      contract and does not regress generic scene loading.
    - Phrase "system-confirmed vs watchdog/suspected" as a provenance and
      missing-data requirement: the report must state the confirmation source
      or say that confirmation evidence is absent.
  - Verification:
    - `cd backend && npx jest src/agent/core/__tests__/conclusionSceneTemplates.test.ts --runInBand`.
    - Do not rely on `validate:skills` for this config file; it does not scan
      conclusion scene templates today.
  - Completed in Batch 1:
    - Added ANR final-output requirements for timeout provenance, confirmation
      source or evidence gap, victim process vs root-cause process/component,
      binder/lock peer evidence, nativePollOnce caveats, and resource
      categories including GC/memory pressure.
    - Covered by focused scene-template tests.

- [x] TODO-002: Memory strategy and conclusion contract
  - Target files:
    - `backend/strategies/memory.strategy.md`
    - `backend/skills/config/conclusion_scene_templates.base.yaml`
    - Strategy loader / conclusion template tests as needed.
  - Current strategy coverage:
    - Memory strategy calls `memory_analysis`, `lmk_analysis`, heap/bitmap/GC/
      dmabuf helper skills, but it is mostly a high-level checklist.
  - Gap:
    - Wiki review requires memory reports to separate Java Heap, Native Heap,
      Graphics/dma-buf, SO/ELF mappings, anonymous mmap, thread stacks,
      RSS/PSS, LMK, freezer, GC pause/churn, heap graph, and external
      ApplicationExitInfo or MemoryLimiter evidence.
  - Implementation:
    - Add a memory `final_report_contract` and phase hints.
    - Add output requirements that prevent "high memory == leak" and
      "LMK/freezer/OOM are interchangeable" conclusions.
    - Keep the first slice to evidence classification, non-mixing rules, and
      missing-evidence wording. Do not imply that every trace can provide
      Native/SO/anonymous-mmap/thread-stack/ApplicationExitInfo/MemoryLimiter
      proof.
  - Verification:
    - Strategy validation.
    - Focused conclusion template tests.
    - Update `activePhaseReminder.test.ts`: the fallback test must move to a
      scene that still has no `phase_hints` after memory gains hints.
    - Update `strategyLoader.spdxHeader.test.ts`: assert memory phase hints and
      memory final report contract section ids.
    - Add/extend final-report contract gate coverage: incomplete memory reports
      should be detected, complete memory reports should pass.
    - Add/extend OpenAI continuation coverage so memory contract gaps trigger
      final-report continuation when the report omits required memory sections.
    - Existing `memory_analysis` eval if runnable with current fixtures; if not,
      document the fixture gap and rely on loader/gate/template tests for this
      narrow prompt/contract slice.
  - Completed in Batch 1:
    - Added memory final-report contract sections for evidence scope, memory
      type breakdown, and confidence/missing-evidence boundaries.
    - Added phase hints for evidence classification, LMK/freezer/OOM boundary
      handling, and GC-churn attribution.
    - Tightened scene-template wording so memory reports separate Java Heap,
      Native Heap, Graphics/dma-buf, RSS/PSS, GC, LMK/freezer, and external
      diagnostics without equating high memory with a leak.
    - Covered by loader, active-phase reminder, final-result gate, OpenAI
      continuation, and scene-template tests.

### Batch 2 - Storage, SQLite, Provider, And I/O

- [ ] TODO-003: Storage/SQLite scene split
  - Target files:
    - Existing `general.strategy.md` or a new dedicated storage/IO strategy only
      if routing supports it cleanly.
    - `backend/skills/config/conclusion_scene_templates.base.yaml`
    - Existing I/O, Binder, ANR, and startup strategy references.
  - Wiki input:
    - File I/O vs SharedPreferences/QueuedWork/fsync, SQLite connection pool,
      WAL/checkpoint, CursorWindow, Room migration, ContentProvider caller vs
      provider-side blocking, and storage capacity/corruption are separate
      proof paths.
  - Implementation:
    - Define the staged evidence contract before adding any new SQL.
    - Avoid treating D-state or a long fsync as database root cause without
      SQLite/provider evidence.
  - Verification:
    - Add focused tests near routing/template surfaces first; defer deep Skill
      SQL until a trace fixture proves it.

### Batch 3 - Input, Focus, And Interaction Latency

- [ ] TODO-004: InputDispatcher and focus-window evidence
  - Target files:
    - `backend/strategies/interaction.strategy.md`
    - `backend/strategies/scroll-response.strategy.md`
    - `backend/strategies/anr.strategy.md` only if a real gap remains after
      TODO-001.
  - Wiki input:
    - Stale events, no-focused-window ANR, InputChannel lifecycle, async
      dispatch/FINISHED ack, WindowInfosListener, and target-window choice are
      separate from app main-thread execution.
  - Implementation:
    - Add concise stage boundaries and output requirements.
    - Do not expand this until tests can validate prompt/routing behavior.
  - Verification:
    - Focused prompt/strategy tests plus trace regression.

### Batch 4 - Graphics Memory, BufferQueue, Fence, And Refresh Policy

- [ ] TODO-005: Graphics-memory and BufferQueue/fence contract
  - Target files:
    - `backend/strategies/scrolling.strategy.md`
    - `backend/strategies/pipeline.strategy.md`
    - Pipeline Skill YAML only after SQL/test feasibility review.
  - Wiki input:
    - BufferQueue state machine, BLAST, GraphicBuffer/dma-buf physical memory,
      fence wait semantics, HWC/SF release path, refresh-rate votes, and
      FrameTimeline confidence boundaries.
  - Implementation:
    - First add report-stage distinctions: BufferQueue logic vs dma-buf memory
      vs fence wait vs SF/HWC policy.
    - Add deterministic Skill SQL only with fixture coverage.
  - Verification:
    - Existing scrolling trace regression plus focused tests for prompt text.

### Batch 5 - Power Background Execution

- [ ] TODO-006: JobScheduler/WorkManager/FGS power governance
  - Target files:
    - `backend/strategies/power.strategy.md`
    - Power Skill YAML only if existing Skills expose the required fields.
  - Wiki input:
    - Job pending reason vs stop reason, WorkManager constraints, FGS timeout,
      Android 16/17 quotas and excessive CPU triggers, wakelock Vitals windows,
      alarm and listener allow-while-idle boundaries.
  - Implementation:
    - Add a concise background-execution evidence section.
    - Keep Android version/policy claims as version-sensitive unless verified
      against current official docs in the implementing turn.
  - Verification:
    - Strategy validation and focused tests. Power Skill smoke if fixture data
      exists.

### Batch 6 - Request-Stage Network And Online Diagnostics

- [ ] TODO-007: Request-stage network evidence contract
  - Target files:
    - `backend/strategies/network.strategy.md`
    - Optional new Skill only if request-stage telemetry has a real input
      source.
  - Wiki input:
    - DNS/connect/TLS/TTFB/body/decode, HTTPDNS cache/source/TTL, ECH, satellite
      or constrained networks, connectivity selection, client/server logs, and
      APM signals.
  - Implementation:
    - Keep packet trace, request telemetry, access-layer logs, and external APM
      as separate evidence classes.
    - Do not infer request stages from `android_network_packets` alone.
  - Verification:
    - Strategy/template tests first; Skill work only with deterministic inputs.

### Batch 7 - Observability And Diagnostic APIs

- [ ] TODO-008: Versioned diagnostic API caveats
  - Target files:
    - Shared strategy templates or knowledge templates, not TypeScript.
  - Wiki input:
    - ApplicationExitInfo, ApplicationStartInfo, ProfilingManager,
      ProfilingTrigger, Play Vitals, App Performance Score, online telemetry,
      and A/B statistics.
  - Implementation:
    - Add only reusable caveats that keep trace proof separate from external
      aggregate evidence.
    - Verify current official docs before adding date-sensitive API or policy
      thresholds.
  - Verification:
    - Prompt/loader tests and `validate:strategies`.

## Current Next Step

Batch 1 is implemented and validated:

- Focused Jest passed for scene templates, memory strategy loading, active
  phase reminders, final-result gate, and OpenAI continuation behavior.
- `validate:strategies`, backend build, scene trace regression, and real
  OpenAI startup E2E passed.
- Read-only post-diff review found no actionable regressions.
- Repository-level `npm run verify:pr` passed, including all 6 scene trace
  regression fixtures.

After this batch is committed and pushed to `main`, continue with Batch 2.
