    evidence_refs: []
    confidence: high
recommendations:
  app:
    - id: app_reduce_frame_work
      priority: P1
      action: Reduce per-frame main and RenderThread work so scheduler delay has less opportunity to cross the frame budget.
      applies_when: The same window shows app thread work near budget plus runnable gaps before render completion.
      risks: Removing work without checking visual correctness can regress content freshness or animation smoothness.
  oem:
    - id: oem_interactive_sched_freq
      priority: P1
      action: Review interactive scheduler placement and short-window frequency ramp behavior for scroll workloads.
      applies_when: Janky frames show runnable delay, low core capacity, or slow frequency ramp while app work is otherwise bounded.
      risks: More aggressive placement or boost rules can increase thermal load and power.

## Summary

The trace points to a mixed ownership problem: the app still benefits from
reducing per-frame work, while the platform owner should inspect whether the
interactive scheduling and frequency response are slow for the scroll window.

## Evidence Notes

Use this case when the root-cause classifier reports `sched_delay_in_slice` and
the critical path includes scheduling or frequency evidence near the dropped
frame.
