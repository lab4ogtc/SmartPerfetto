recommendations:
  app:
    - id: app_precompile_shader
      priority: P0
      action: Precompile or warm up shaders before the first interactive scroll.
      applies_when: RenderThread shader or pipeline compilation slices overlap dropped-frame windows.
      risks: Warmup moves CPU and memory cost earlier, so schedule it outside critical startup or first-input paths.
  oem:
    - id: oem_gpu_sched_response
      priority: P1
      action: Inspect GPU frequency response and RenderThread scheduling during shader-heavy frames.
      applies_when: App-side shader work remains after precompile and the same frames show low frequency or scheduling delay.
      risks: Frequency or boost policy changes can increase power and should be scoped to short interactive windows.

## Summary

The dropped frames are dominated by RenderThread shader or pipeline compilation
inside the visible scroll window. This is primarily an app-actionable issue
when the compilation is synchronous and repeatable on first exposure.

## Evidence Notes

Treat the recommendation as strong only when the trace contains shader-related
RenderThread slices inside the janky frame window and the root-cause classifier
reported `shader_compile`.
